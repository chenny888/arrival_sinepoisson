# arrival_sinepoisson
The MATLAB code for "Can customer arrival rates be modelled by sine waves?"

To run main.m, the data must be input to the variable "obs". So obs is of the form

obs = [0.1, 0.23, 1.3, ...]

The entries are the arrival time of the sequence (in order), with a consistent time unit (say days).
